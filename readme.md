# The language collection.

Welcome to the language collection. This is a repo for documenting all computer languages in existance.

## Type.

**Implementation**: Has a standard compiler or interpreter, implemented by the official developers.

**Spec**: Has a standard specification, not implemented by the official developers.

**No spec**: Has no standard specification, and is not implemented by the official developers.
