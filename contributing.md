We are glad you want to contribute to owr effort! Please do follow these guidelines before opening a pull request.

## Do you need to open a pr?

While we apprecieate your contribution effort, if you want to propose a language, open an issue! If we think it's worthy, feel free to add it to the collection using a pull request. If you want to update an existing language, (eg, new release of a language) open a pull request.

## Adding a language

To add a language, you need to:

- Fork the repo on github. This can be done by clicking on the "Fork" button in the top right corner of the page.
- Clone your fork locally.
- Create a new directory in the languages folder and name it after the language you want to add.
- Create the language file (eg, `languages/rust/rust.rs`)
- Create a file with the same name as the directory, but with the extension ".md".
- Fill the .md file with the language description. This needs to be a breif description of the language, creator, first appeared, license, and type (type can be seen in the readme). Then, add a breif history of the language, an overview of the language, and a versioning section with the latest version. 
- Once you have created the language file and the .md file, you can open a pull request.
- Fill everything and create it.
- Wait for it to accept!
